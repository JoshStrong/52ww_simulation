# 52ww_simulation

Aim: To develop a model which can estimate, by speciality, the times by which we expect to have removed all patients from the elective (admitted) waiting list that are waiting longer than 52+ weeks or waiting longer than recommended.

Outputs include:

- The number of patients on the waiting list
- The times at which 52+ week waiters will be cleared
- The times at which those patients waiting longer than recommended will be cleared
- The mean, median and maximum waiting times for patients which are removed from the waiting list

Priorities:

- Priority 2: 4 weeks
- Priority 3: 13 weeks
- Priority 4: 52 weeks

Only includes the simulation function with prioritizes P2s first and then all the others
